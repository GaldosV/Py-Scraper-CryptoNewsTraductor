Título de la noticia: What Grayscale’s S-3 registration means for its spot Bitcoin ETF prospects
Contenido de la noticia: On Oct. 19, Grayscale Investments filed an S-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).
This move reflects the company’s aspiration to list the shares on NYSE Arca (a subsidiary of the NYSE headquartered in Chicago)under the GBTC symbol.
Form S-3 registrations are regulatory filings used to simplify the reporting process for issuers of registered securities, providing a streamlined route for companies wishing to raise capital. With the filing of an S-3 form, Grayscale has expressed its readiness to issue shares on an ongoing basis upon the approval of NYSE Arca’s application on Form 19b-4 to list the shares and the effectiveness of the Form S-3 to register the shares.
In other words, filing Form S-3 signifies that Grayscale is confident it met all its reporting requirements to the SEC and has requested the go-ahead to register and issue shares.
The recent decision by the SEC not to appeal Grayscale’s court victory potentially hastens the review of Grayscale’s application. The SEC’s reluctance to challenge the August court ruling could ultimately result in a Bitcoin spot ETF, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. This has been a longstanding goal for Grayscale, as it could alleviate the significant discount GBTC shares currently trade at compared to its net asset value due to the trust’s lack of redemption features.
This pivotal development arrives following a lengthy legal battle centered around the SEC’s inconsistent handling of spot and futures Bitcoin ETFs. Grayscale argued that both fund types share similar risks and are priced based on the same underlying spot markets. The appeals court agreed, stating the SEC had failed to substantiate the substantial difference between the two arrangements, leading to the unjust rejection of Grayscale’s application.
Moreover, in light of the SEC’s decision not to contest the court ruling, other asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco may see their similar filings for a spot Bitcoin ETF expedited. Grayscale has described itself as “operationally ready” to convert GBTC into an ETF immediately upon receiving SEC approval.
